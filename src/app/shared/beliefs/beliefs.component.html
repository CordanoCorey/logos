    Statement of Faith
  </h2>
  <p [@lightSpeedInOnEnter]>
    The following statement of faith is taken directly from the Logos School
    Bylaws:
  </p>
  <div class="beliefs-list">
    <p *ngFor="let belief of beliefs; let i = index" [@zoomInLeftOnEnter]>
      <span class="order">{{ i + 1 }}.</span>{{ belief.message }}
    </p>
  </div>
  <p [@lightSpeedInOnEnter]>
    As a charter member of the Association of Classical, Christian Schools
    (ACCS), Logos School also subscribes to the ACCS statement of faith, which
    is found in that associationâ€™s by-laws (essentially the first two chapters
    of the Westminster Confession of Faith).
  </p>
  <p [@lightSpeedInOnEnter]>
    While we hold to a distinctly Reformed doctrinal tradition, we welcome and
    respect other Christian perspectives in the Logos community.
