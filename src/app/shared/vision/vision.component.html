        Those with kids know that we’ve now entered an infinite question loop.
        As the child asks the question “What is that?” the parent subtly answers
        the question, “what is that made of?” revealing an unconscious
        presupposition that a thing is equal to the sum of its parts. Luckily,
        “the science” says we can end what should be an infinite loop with an
        “elementary particle” called a “quark.” The sisters roar with laughter
        at the term.
      </logos-words>
      <logos-words>
        Until the children started laughing, the adults in the room didn’t see
        the obvious humor in the realization that our best minds have chosen to
        veil such a fundamental building block of the physical world within a
        word of such quirky arbitrariness. Similarly, the obvious question
        regarding the entwined particles became obvious only after the
        four-year-old asked it…
      </logos-words>
      <logos-words> “But what holds them together?” </logos-words>
      <logos-words>Oh, the mind of a child.</logos-words>
      <logos-words title="Wisdom of the World">
        Scientists have given the name “strong force” to whatever it is that

        It can be a scary ordeal as parents to watch our babies transition
        overnight from first word babblers to burgeoning amateur philosophers.
        Kids ask practical questions that demand spiritual answers.
      </logos-words>
      <logos-words> “Where is heaven? What color is it?” </logos-words>
      <logos-words>
        The even scarier moment is the realization that whatever your answer,
        they will believe you in perpetuity… Or, at least until you’ve sowed
        enough doubt for them to begin questioning your reliability.
      </logos-words>
      <logos-words
        >They follow up their questions iteratively with “Why?” and “Who says?”
        until they reach an answer from authority. “Because I said so” or
        “scientists say” or “God says.” Parents must decide beforehand where
        this infinite loop terminates – which authority is the ultimate source
        of truth.
      </logos-words>
      <logos-words>
        Science is the cop out answer. Beyond the obvious limitation of modern
        science, which ignores the entirety of an ever-present spiritual
        reality, it veils a limited understanding of physical reality behind
        confident boilerplate and appeals to “consensus.” For example, gravity,
        (not to be confused with the “strong force,”) is the natural phenomenon
        by which all things with mass or energy are attracted to one another. In
        other words, gravity is the phenomenon of things gravitating toward one
        another…and here we are, back in our infinite loop.
      </logos-words>
      <logos-words>
        Failure to recognize the mystery that pervades reality closes the door
        to further exploration and blinds the incurious and the philosophically
        entrenched to alternative paradigms. Modern education restricts learning
        to the passive props in the great story, excluding the most interesting
        questions about why the props are there in the first place, and the role
        the actors are to play on such a stage. In this setting, the right
        question is the one that enters the infinite loop and is the be avoided.
        The goal should be to get them to ask the right questions, and to never
        stop asking them.
      </logos-words>
      <logos-words>
        The Bible says that there are only two stories – one with answers
        terminating in “I say” and one in which the Word of God defines Truth.
        If parents want to explain the world and all of its quarks to their
        children by positing swarms of microscopic fairies, that is their right
        in a free(-ish) society…at least until the government says otherwise.
        God says parents ought to be able to define for their children the story
        they are in. But without God, you will eventually have to explain where
        rights come from in the first place and, without appealing to His
        revelation, why anyone ought to do anything. For those philosophical
        pioneers on a pilgrimage toward this insurmountable summit: May the
        strong force be with you!

      <logos-words title="Word of God">
        As for Logos School parents, our children’s story is set in God’s world,
        which He spoke into existence ex nihilo – out of nothing
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Gen 1:3, Ps 33:6"></logos-bible-citation>.
        Through the Word, the Logos, all things were made and by Him all things
        are being made new
        <logos-bible-citation cite="2 Cor 5:17, Rev 21:5"></logos-bible-citation

        entered into His own creation to redeem it
        <logos-bible-citation cite="John 1:14"></logos-bible-citation>. He is,
        therefore, both the storyteller and the hero of the story – the author
        of salvation
        <logos-bible-citation
          cite="Heb
        5:9"
        ></logos-bible-citation
        >. As the instantiated Word of God, Jesus is the exact imprint of God’s
        nature on the Earth
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Heb 1:3"></logos-bible-citation>. the Truth
        incarnate and the personal archetype for all earthly predication. From
        Him and through Him and to Him are all things
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Rom 11:36"></logos-bible-citation>. As all
        things hold together in Him
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Col 1:16-20"></logos-bible-citation>, He
        upholds the universe by the word of His power
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Heb 1:2-3"></logos-bible-citation>. So, what
        is the smallest thing in God’s spoken world? Words. And what holds the
        cosmos and all its quarks together? The Word of God – Jesus Christ, the
        Logos.
      </logos-words>
      <logos-words>
        Only such a self-contained infinity, the ideal of unity in diversity,
        can account for all the quarks of reality. From this perspective,
        creation is a fine-tuned work of art, the self-portrait of a
        transcendent Creator. He reveals Himself throughout nature and
        redemptive history to fallen bearers of His image, a select few serving
        as the earthen vessels within whom the One who caused Light to shine out
        of darkness has shone in our hearts the Light of the knowledge of the
        glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
        <logos-bible-citation cite="2 Cor 4:6-7"></logos-bible-citation>. In
        weakness He provides strength
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Matt 5:5"></logos-bible-citation>, that we
        may never mistake ourselves for the One in Whom are hidden all the
        treasures of wisdom and knowledge
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Col 2:3"></logos-bible-citation>. In order
        to attain wisdom, we have to maintain the sense of childlike wonder of
        one who still searches for treasure, and who trusts his father’s
        treasure map because he trusts his father.

      <logos-words title="Myth of Neutrality"
        >Before identifying goals in education, we must ask the more fundamental
        question: By what standard do we measure success? If God created out of
        nothing, entered into His creation, died, and rose again, then His Word
        must be the final word, and His standard the ultimate standard. The
        alternative to the standard of God’s Word in Scripture is not freedom
        from standards altogether. Notice that the alleged absence of a higher
        standard – a professed worldview neutrality – is itself a standard. In
        practice, some authority’s constraints are always enforced as ordained
        norms. Given the implied influence of educational overlordship on
        generations of children, zealous influence seekers inevitably race in to
        fill the God-sized void left when Scripture is abandoned.
      </logos-words>
      <logos-words title="State of Education"
        >Absent an authoritative word from Scripture delegating decisions about
        children’s education to parents, the responsibility has increasingly
        been outsourced to the state. The fall into state control over education
        is so pervasive today that government standards are the unquestioned
        authority not only in secular schools, but also in Christian schools who
        have allowed a pragmatic dependence on government to supersede their
        biblical partnership with parents. The result is the imposition of a
        worldly, politicized standard that is volatile, fallible, and, often,
        either an arbitrary exercise of power or downright premeditated
        indoctrination. The state says “we know better than you (the parents)
        what’s best for your children” and we respond with “well, everyone else
        is doing it” or “I went to government school and I turned out okay.”
        This generational apathy toward an encroaching state is the fruit of a
        century-long, coordinated effort aimed at imposing a secularized,
        progressive education. In the words of the great preacher, Dr. Voddie
        Baucham, "if we send our kids to Caesar for an education, we should not
        be surprised when they come back as Romans"<logos-citation
        ></logos-citation>.</logos-words
      >
      <logos-words title="By What Authority?">
        Classical Christian schools work with and for parents. Logos School
        takes every measure to protect against a drift into dependence on the
        state. For example, we go out of our way not to accept any government
        funds. Our educational mandate does not come from government, but from
        parents committed to bringing their children up in the discipline and
        instruction of the Lord
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Eph 6:4"></logos-bible-citation>. Our desire
        is to be a service to parents, not a replacement for them. Those parents
        who have elected to apply God’s standard in Scripture to the
        discipleship of their children can rest assured that this perspective
        will be reinforced and intellectually justified at Logos School.

        Modern progressive education falls into the fatal conceits of assuming
        knowledge of the future
        <logos-bible-citation cite="James 4:14-15"></logos-bible-citation> and
        ignoring the wisdom from the past
        <logos-bible-citation cite="1 Peter 5:5"></logos-bible-citation>. The
        cynic may suggest that the goal is generations of cookie cutter cogs
        stamped out by and for the machine. To the extent that truth is
        acquired, it is unjustified and fleeting. Rather than cultivating virtue
        – the shaping of students according to a standard that persists from age
        to age – man-made values are instilled in service to a modern
        institutional agenda. Too often, products of a progressive education
        don’t know what they don’t know because, in shutting themselves off from
        the past, they have become captives to their historical moment.

        Classical, Christ-centered Education (CCE) is the education of the free

        particular attention to culture as man’s creative interaction with
        creation, relating the biblical faith to the world around us. Operating
        under the assumption that God is efficaciously working through history
        towards His ends, CCE directs student attentions toward the
        manifestation of His truth, goodness, and beauty wherever it may be
        found, while painting a cohesive picture of what He is accomplishing
        through the workings of Spirit-guided humanity. CCE immerses students in
        the best stories that human tradition has to offer, always in the
        context of the overarching true story of the Gospel.

        Perhaps never was a character so sure of his role in a story as was Toy
        Story’s Buzz Lightyear. In two minutes of screen time, we know his
        backstory and his intended character arc. He is a Space Ranger from the
        Universe Protection Unit and his mission is to protect the galaxy from
        the Evil Emperor Zurg, the sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance! When he
        is confronted with his true identity, he spirals indiscriminately into a
        nihilistic existential crisis. His self-perception comes crashing down
        to a low point marked by a self-identification as “Mrs. Nesbit” (a
        prophetic detail that shouldn’t be lost on the modern viewer). For Buzz,
        “finding himself” meant no longer having to contend, literally and
        figuratively, with gravity. Upon acquiring true self-knowledge, his

        child in an institution for 12,000+ hours during their formative years

        This ideological contrast is not a one-off detail of a latent belief
        system that never materializes in day-to-day instruction. Atheistic
        materialism and its logical outgrowths, along with the whole corpus of
        unbelieving doctrine are ingrained in the curriculum of secular schools
        and taught as gospel truth with no mention of alternative paradigms.
        Many Christians have accepted the self-defeating presuppositions of
        unbelief (e.g. self-love, age of the universe, man is fundamentally
        good, etc.), as “settled science” and looked to harmonize them with a
        Christian worldview, having in the process compromised truth that
        belongs to the divine archetype of harmony Himself. The result is a
        watered-down, impotent Christianity that has no authoritative word from
        God for a secularized society that has no hope for the future. To
        attempt to instill morality in such a culture is to assume that a
        collective moral obligation can arise out of an assumed great solidarity
        of nervous systems <logos-citation></logos-citation>. To believe that
        knowledge (true, justified belief) is possible while simultaneously
        believing that reason is “simply the unforeseen and unintended
        by-product of mindless matter at one stage of its endless and aimless
        becoming” is to, at the same moment, accept a conclusion and discredit
        the only testimony on which that conclusion can be based
        <logos-citation></logos-citation>. If you’ve heard of the Titanic, then

      <logos-words title="Into a Narrative">
        At Logos School, we tell a different story. Like the voice of Mufasa
        imploring Simba to abandon the meaninglessness of the “hakuna matata”
        lifestyle and “REMEMBER who (he is)” so that he can, therefore, go
        accept his great commission, Logos School aims in all of its educational
        pursuits at reminding students of their identity in Christ and the high
        calling such a status entails. Our curriculum does not include merely a
        list of great books, but a canon of literature formulated for the
        purpose of writing students into the narrative of a transcendent and
        knowable reality. We know we can know things because we have it on the
        authority of the One Who made all things
        <logos-bible-citation cite="John 1:3, Col 2:3"></logos-bible-citation>.
        That He entered into history assures us that nothing we encounter in
        life is without meaning
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Eccl 7:14"></logos-bible-citation> and that
        our every action plays a role in accomplishing His purposes

      <logos-words title="Objective Truth">
        Pontius Pilate provided the prototypical delineation for the world we
        see today when he, before unknowingly setting into motion the event on
        which all of history turns, looked on the face of Jesus and asked Him:
        “What is truth?”
        <logos-bible-citation cite="John 18:38"></logos-bible-citation>. There
        are only two stories – one of God’s objectivity and one of man’s
        relativism. Had Pilate known the story he was in, he would have
        recognized his question as the ultimate irony since he posed it while
        standing face-to-face with The Truth Incarnate. Luckily, for the sake of
        our eternal souls, Pilate cast himself as a character in the wrong
        story. (But then again, what is luck to a Christian??) The story that
        students at Logos School are invited to join is the one in which
        objective truth exists, and He is a person.

      <logos-words title="Let it Go">
        Consistent application of the world’s assumptions about human autonomy
        are clearly articulated by Elsa in Frozen’s most climactic song, and
        probably Disney’s most popular of the last 20 years, “Let it Go.” Beyond
        the undeniable audio and visual appeal of the scene, Elsa’s impassioned
        proclamation of “No right, no wrong, no rules for me. I’m free,”
        resonates with a secular culture that has come to this same consensus
        conclusion about truth and ethics. The problem is that what Elsa calls
        liberation – freedom from standards outside herself – the bible calls
        slavery to a wayward worldliness
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Rom 6:16-18"></logos-bible-citation>. What
        the world calls being “true to oneself,” the bible calls suppression of
        truth in unrighteousness
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Rom 1:18"></logos-bible-citation> and
        antithetical to the biblical ideal of freedom
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Rom 6"></logos-bible-citation>.
      </logos-words>
      <logos-words title="Relativism">
        Elsa’s cathartic transformation in this scene is reminiscent of Disney’s
        most defining scene – Cinderella’s adornment by her fairy godmother.
        Both convey a theme of long-awaited rebirth. The bestowals differ with
        respect to the reception from the recipient princess and the source of
        the liberation’s inevitability. Cinderella’s humble catharsis was
        imminent because hers was an imagined world in which an objective
        standard for morality reigned – that which is the very target of Elsa’s
        ire. In our world, when the objectivity of a supreme, immutable God
        Who’s character defines right and wrong is removed, relativism prevails
        and ethics is subjected to the whims of public opinion or, more likely,
        to the will of the powerful. While Frozen’s Arendelle has a benevolent
        ice queen to fill that void, we are left wandering undirected amidst
        cultural tidal forces, like perpetual children “tossed to and fro by the
        waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine”
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Eph 4:14"></logos-bible-citation>.
      </logos-words>
      <logos-words title="Truth, Goodness, Beauty">
        Absent an immutable interpretive context, we not only lose ethical
        standards, but truth, beauty, and all other abstractions we assume, in
        our vanity, to be derived from lived experience
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Eph 4:17-18"></logos-bible-citation>. When
        truth is subject to the whims of fallen individuals, every truth
        proposition effectively reduces to a question of mere preference: “Do
        you prefer sugar in your coffee?” So as to truth.

      <logos-words title="Remove Organ, Demand Function">
        Like the movie Shrek – which wittingly undermines the very established
        cultural categories it relies upon for its humor – could not exist in a
        world where ogres and dragons are the good guys and no one knows the
        muffin man, so we, though often unwittingly, remove the organ and demand
        the function. The fatal assumption made by those looking to preserve the
        traditions of the West, the ones that are worth preserving, is that the
        battle is over the practicality of the traditions themselves and not
        over the underlying, foundational truths they embody. In recovering the
        heritage of the Christian West in education, Logos School proceeds with
        the understanding that these traditions, insofar as they are true, good,
        and beautiful, were not developed but were discovered. That is, the
        goodness they manifest was built into the fabric of reality itself by
        the Creator and is revelatory of His character
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Rom 1:19-20, Ps 19:1"></logos-bible-citation

      </logos-words>
      <logos-words title="Best Life Now">
        The temptation of humanity since the Fall has been to develop human
        traditions that run contrary to the character of God, in rebellion
        against an ultimate standard that prescribes how we ought to live. If I
        remove “the way and the truth and the life” from my thought processes, I
        am left hopelessly relying on “my truth” to navigate “my best life now”
        according to my own standard. However untenable, this autonomous outlook
        is undeniably attractive, to modern youth especially. Logos School
        endeavors to never be the source of introduction to worldly indulgences,
        but to be constantly aware of popular culture temptations bombarding the
        children entrusted to our care and address them critically when they
        arise in classroom discussion.

      <logos-words title="Property of the Redeemer">
        Many cultural idols are unavoidable. Which of us raising a daughter can
        honestly say she has never heard of Elsa? Our philosophy at Logos School
        is to neither embrace nor ignore the Elsas of the world, but to
        critically identify redeeming qualities that are redeemable through the
        work of the Spirit. Much of what the culture produces, though to varying
        degrees mired the assumed autonomy of a humanity in need of redemption,
        exhibits genuine fruit of the Spirit that needs to be directed to the
        glory of God
        <logos-bible-citation cite="James 1:17"></logos-bible-citation>. We
        study the great works of history, many of them produced by unbelievers,
        seeking out truth wherever it may be found, while highlighting the
        limits of worldly wisdom and the futility of secular thought. We strive
        to preserve the genuine insights offered by history’s greatest thinkers
        while contrasting the foolishness of autonomous reasoning with the
        wisdom of a redeemed counterpart. Rather than abandoning culture
        altogether, thereby surrendering all intellectual and aesthetic activity
        to the world
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Matt 7:6"></logos-bible-citation>, we
        dethrone cultural idols by sharing the Gospel and winning the battle of
        ideas through hearts and minds.

        In order to be in the world but not of the world
        <logos-bible-citation cite="John 17:14-16"></logos-bible-citation>,
        classical Christian school educators must possess a thorough grasp of
        the distinctiveness of the Christian position, clearly discerning the
        antithesis between believing and unbelieving thought. The classical
        curriculum steers the sensibilities toward, for example, Rembrandt and
        away from Jackson Pollock, while Christ-centered instruction contrasts
        the worldview that values the former with the intellectual incoherence
        of that which produced the latter. Although worldview training brings
        about the kind of clear thinking that makes it difficult to mindlessly
        enjoy great movies like Shrek, it preserves the saltiness of young
        Christians who are the God-designated salt of the earth
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Matt 5:13"></logos-bible-citation>. The 70%
        of Christian children who fall away from the faith during their freshman
        year of college likely began the deconstruction process much earlier.
        CCE molds future leaders who know what they believe and why they believe
        it, who know what the world believes and why it’s foolish, and who are
        prepared to assume their position as the city on a hill in their role as
        the light of the world

        <logos-bible-citation cite="Eph 6:4"></logos-bible-citation>. Often
        translated “discipline and instruction,” the Greek word Paideia here
        means enculturation – the process by which culture is handed on by the
        society and acquired by the individual. Therefore, the calling of the
        Christian school is discipleship unto Christ, Who gave Himself up for
        the life of the world, and the transmission of the culture of His body,
        the Church.

      <logos-words title="Christian Counter-Culture">
        In order to invite our future generations to participate in a Christian

        inerrancy of Scripture in its totality, and confirm the sufficiency of
        Scripture by invoking all of Christ for all of life in the local
        community of Carlisle, PA. In faithful, disciplined submission to the

        The way from the truth of God’s revealed word to spiritual life was

        again, and poured out His Spirit on believers
        <logos-bible-citation cite="2 Peter 1:2-4"></logos-bible-citation>. We
        are called in turn to testify to the truth of His Gospel. What we cannot
        communicate through words must be demonstrated through life lived in
        imitation of Christ
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Heb 13:7"></logos-bible-citation>. Grabbing

        At the cross lies the proper response to grace – gratitude and obedience
        from the heart. On display in the environment of Logos School is the
        unity of believers around God’s truth, and only that. We aspire to live
        and work in such a way that is compelling
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Matt 5:16"></logos-bible-citation>, and
        which causes onlookers to be drawn to the source of the hope which is
        radiated through our living testimony
        <logos-bible-citation cite="1 Peter 3:15"></logos-bible-citation>. We
        emit a palatable air of humility, the natural response which follows
        from knowing Who God is and realizing the obligation to be thankful to
        Him <logos-bible-citation cite="Rom 1:21"></logos-bible-citation>. We
        reflect the cross through a willingness to sacrifice, a refusal to
        complain, the exercise of true authority that never accepts flattery and
        true submission that never grovels. Aware of the unearned gift we’ve
        been given and liberated by the freedom it brings, we work as for the
        Lord and not for men in every undertaking
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Col 3:23"></logos-bible-citation>. Most

      <logos-words title="Spirit of Accusation">
        With God as the standard, our goal is not to produce strict adherents to
        the standard in order for the school to run efficiently like a machine,
        but to bring students to love the standard so that Logos School becomes
        fruitful like a tree. An atmosphere of student order and cheerful
        obedience can only be achieved by avoiding the biblical pitfall of
        “boiling the kid in its mother’s milk”
        <logos-bible-citation
          cite="Ex 23:19, 34:26; Deut 14:21"
        ></logos-bible-citation
        >. This occurs when things that are good, desirable, and which lead to
        spiritual life, such as piety or science, are turned into that which
        leads to destruction, like pietism or scientism. Christian schools must
        take special care not to boil the kid in legalism. Rules exist to be
        enforced, and they should be. But the law that once condemned was
        written on the hearts of believers in the person of the Spirit, words
        proceeding from the One who nailed all condemnation to the cross at
        Cavalry <logos-bible-citation cite="Rom 8:1-4"></logos-bible-citation>.
        We, therefore, condemn only the Spirit’s antithesis that the world runs
        on – the spirit of accusation itself
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Rom 8:1, James 4:11"></logos-bible-citation
        >. The devil is self-righteous and so is the world
        <logos-bible-citation cite="James 4:4"></logos-bible-citation>, but the
        Christian knows that his righteousness is not his own, since his is the
        only faith tradition not beholden to works of law for salvation. Rather,
        indwelt by the Spirit, we follow the person of the Son, and direct all
        glory to the Father, so that no man may boast.
      </logos-words>
      <logos-words>
        As recipients of the grace of God we must adopt a humble boldness,
        characterized neither by compromise nor arrogance, toward the
        unbelieving world. Fulfillment of the first great commandment – love for
        God in response to His grace with all of one’s heart, soul, and mind –
        is the only necessary and sufficient condition for loving one’s
        neighbor, the second great commandment
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Matt 22:37-40"></logos-bible-citation>. We
        must teach students to love without compromising truth. They should see
        the goodness of God incarnated through Christians living in faithful
        imitation of Jesus, as we, by holding the mirror of the Word up to our
        lives, demonstrate that there is a Christian way to do everything.

        Classical education seeks to join imitation with understanding in its
        transmission of a shared culture and instruction of the younger
        generation in its meaning. Students are formed over time as they learn
        to justify intellectually what has first been embraced sympathetically.
        The piety on display at Logos School represents a refusal to be
        conformed to the ways of the world, while rehearsing the proper
        disposition toward God through a willingness to be transformed by the
        renewal of the mind, with rightly ordered loves and attentions turned in
        a counter-cultural direction toward the true, the good, and the

        Regardless of the underlying philosophy of education, all teaching

        belief. Classical Christian educators hold a deep conviction that no
        fact is teachable unless brought into relation with the unifying context
        embodied by Jesus Christ, the arche or origin of all knowledge
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Col 1:17, John 1:1"></logos-bible-citation>.
        Without this infinite reference point, each finite point becomes a
        tidbit of atomized truth, disconnected from the true vine, that
        eventually withers and gets thrown away
        <logos-bible-citation cite="John 15:1-6"></logos-bible-citation>. To
        undertake the task of learning without invoking the Word would be like
        performing a critical analysis of Hamlet without reference to the prince
        of Denmark…or Shakespeare. At Logos School, the pursuit of knowledge is

        Failure to live up to the “Christ-centered” designation looks like a
        Christian school that mimics government schools in every subject, then
        tacks on a bible class for “Christian worldview training” that is
        disconnected from its applications in the worldly context. While we do
        have a bible class and we don’t invoke the name of the Lord before every
        spelling word or multiplication fact, each individual student learns to
        act in the spirit of that pesky, yet fearless, young truth-teller from
        the Emperor’s New Clothes, pointing to the unacknowledged elephant in
        the modern classroom – that possession of justified truth presupposes a
        Justifier. As educators operating outside government-imposed academic
        confines, we liberally exercise the freedom to call the Justifier of all
        truth by His name.

      <logos-words title="Puzzle">
        Consider the lifelong process of organizing thoughts as that of
        assembling a puzzle which depicts what is true about reality. Throughout
        the course of our lives we are showered with puzzle pieces, ideas the
        world would have us incorporate into our vision of the whole, but we are
        without the picture on the front of the puzzle box. We are offered the
        backdrops of those farther along in the construction process as tempting
        appeals to model our own puzzle in their image. The classically educated
        have the anthology of historical works of man to inform their
        discernment of true pieces from false ones – fruit of Spirit-informed
        thought that should be preserved from wisdom of the world that should be
        discarded. Only a Christ-centered education provides students with the
        picture on the front of the puzzle box, as it is revealed in God’s Word.
        Without it, the learning process perpetuates permanently in a state
        resembling a multitude of unfinished puzzles with connected clusters
        disjointly dispersed about an expansive floor. This is the process of
        unjustified, intellectual abstraction divorced from that
        all-encompassing, concrete context within Whom man lives and moves and
        has his being
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Acts 17:28"></logos-bible-citation>, as man
        separates what God joins and joins what God separates. A Christ-centered
        approach to learning stands alone in its ability to account for belief
        that is both true and justified, and is therefore solely capable of
        achieving the overarching goal of imparting knowledge through education.

      <logos-words title="Liberal Arts"
        >Liberal arts are the skills required to achieve knowledge. Mastering
        the tools of learning forms students who are always curious, always
        pursuing truth, and capable of handily learning any new subject. CCE
        employs the so-called “master art” of the Trivium for learning across
        subjects. The Trivium is a methodology for producing knowledge of the
        truth in three arts or stages of academic development – Grammar, Logic,
        and Rhetoric. During the Grammar stage, students learn to be at home in
        language as they accumulate raw data (e.g. multiplication facts,
        geography, spelling words, etc.) through poetic and imitative practices,
        learning what words mean and how that meaning is conveyed. In the Logic
        (or Dialectic) stage, students engage in disputations about the
        reliability of accumulated knowledge from the Grammar stage, training
        their minds to perceive truth and validity in so doing. The Rhetoric
        stage is then the winsome, persuasive application of grammar and logic.
        Students learn to develop a thesis (this and not that) then stand their
        ground with wisdom and eloquence through poetic expression and clarity
        of style. These arts (or skills) were historically considered the arts
        of the free man because they provided freedom to those who studied them
        – the freedom that results from learning how to think.
      </logos-words>
      <logos-words title="History">
        The liberal arts represent a tradition that CCE seeks to recover from
        history and improve upon in the present. Starting with the belief that
        God is active in history, we follow the unfolding narrative of His
        Kingdom people, their doctrinal and cultural development, and their
        interactions in the broader historical context. Through this lens,
        history is decorated with the illuminating providence of the divine
        decree. Starting with Creation, the Fall, the Flood, and the four
        empires from Daniel
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Dan 2"></logos-bible-citation>, all the way
        up through the Reformation and modern America, we are living in the
        everlasting Kingdom of God
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Dan 2:44"></logos-bible-citation> and its
        story is the one we tell. Practically, knowledge of the past provides
        interpretations of the present and prescriptions for the future,
        particularly whether the remedy for cultural decline lies in
        enlightenment or, alternatively, in reformation.
      </logos-words>
      <logos-words>
        Unlike the postmodern ethos – an affront to stability of meaning
        characterized by open dismissal of objective facts – that dominates
        contemporary thought, Enlightenment thinkers recognized the necessity of
        grounding reality in objective truth; even if many (e.g. Immanuel Kant)
        ultimately (and unironically) determined truth (and God) to be
        unknowable. Predecessors of the Enlightenment, the heroes of the
        Scientific Revolution believed as a presupposition that a perfect God
        had woven perfect mathematical harmonies into the world that reflected
        the truth of reality. The great scientists and mathematicians of
        Reformation Europe (Newton, Euler, Faraday, etc.) studied God’s creation
        experimentally (induction) and applied mathematical formulas to natural
        phenomena (deduction). Contrary to popular historical obscurantism, it
        was belief in a rational and orderly God that formed the preconditions
        for the rise of natural science in the West.
      </logos-words>
      <logos-words title="Science">
        Contemporary science dogmatically embraces a “natural selection acting
        on random mutations” paradigm in which a thing can be explained in its
        totality in terms of matter, force, and energy, without any reference to
        its essential meaning or purpose. Abandoning the belief that reality
        itself is grounded in a personal context
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Acts 17:28"></logos-bible-citation> means
        science education must necessarily divorce fact from meaning, truth from
        value, and the aspiring scholar from the unchanging source of all
        knowledge toward Whom cultivated affections are meant to be directed
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Rom 1:21"></logos-bible-citation>. Under
        this narrow, robotic definition of natural science, knowing something
        means knowing how to apply it, not how to justify it.
      </logos-words>
      <logos-words>
        If ultimate reality consists merely of chance-related particulars, then
        probabilities must be calculated against the backdrop of an effectively
        infinite, impersonal void. Conversely, in the person of Christ we have
        the covenantal promise of stability and regularity in nature
        <logos-bible-citation
          cite="Gen 8:22, Jer 33:20-21"
        ></logos-bible-citation
        >. Believers can therefore justifiably utilize induction, the process of
        empirical reasoning – from observed patterns in definite experience to
        general principles of cause and effect – on which the scientific method
        depends. Far from being antagonistic, the relationship between faith and
        science is a complementary one. Grace does not destroy nature, but
        perfects it. Luckily, for the sake of scientific advancement, the choice
        between Christ and chaos is decided for us every morning when the sun
        rises, whether or not we choose to recognize grace as grace
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Matt 5:45"></logos-bible-citation>.

      <logos-words title="Math">
        If we assume, with an unbelieving faith, that the world is fundamentally
        chaotic and not intelligently designed, we have removed the intellectual
        basis not just for the inductive reasoning in science but for deductive
        reasoning in math also. The reality is that we live in a universe that
        is inexplicably ordered given atheistic assumptions. Math seeks to
        discover, examine, and apply those fundamental laws by which God gives
        order to His creation. It gives us a glimpse into God’s consistency and
        incorruptibility
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Heb 13:8"></logos-bible-citation>. The
        engineer, for example, implicitly trusts in these qualities for
        assurance that his bridge, mathematically modelled as an infinite number
        of infinitesimally small mathematical points, will stand the test of the
        physical world. For the one who has eyes to see, conceptions of infinity
        elicited by tangible objects in the real-world paint a picture in the
        mind’s eye of a God Who is simultaneously infinite and omnipresent
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Jer 23:24"></logos-bible-citation>.
      </logos-words>
      <logos-words>
        Scholars of antiquity viewed the world through this lens of discrete and
        continuous magnitudes. Hence, their formulation of the Quadrivium, which
        was taught after the Trivium and laid the foundation for the study of
        philosophy and theology, as arithmetic (number in the abstract),
        geometry (number in space), music (number in time), and astronomy
        (number in space and time). Arithmetic explores relationships among
        discrete quantities, and geometry investigates extended continuous
        magnitudes. Astronomy provided the empirical impulse for gathering
        mathematical data in experimental science. Music set the trajectory for
        theoretical mathematics in pursuit of a grand unified theory. Arithmetic
        and geometry together offer the tools of mathematical proof and
        conceptions of unity. This unity, between mathematical processes
        conceived in the mind and the temporal reality of the physical universe,
        need not exist except for the fact that God created them both.
      </logos-words>
      <logos-words title="Philosophy">
        This problem of reconciling the finite and the infinite, the discrete
        and the continuous, temporal chance and abstract ideas, material
        particulars and rational forms, fact and meaning, time and eternity,
        being and becoming, etc. is called the problem of the one and the many.
        It is the intellectual dilemma that gave rise to the discipline of
        philosophy, which pursues the unity of knowledge of reality that lies
        behind value judgements of what is true, good, and beautiful. The
        apostle Paul warns us not to be taken captive by philosophy and empty
        deceit according to human tradition and not according to Christ
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Col. 2:8"></logos-bible-citation>. In other
        words, without revelation, our two ways of knowing things – through
        reason (the one) and experience (the many) – cannot be trusted to cohere
        through any metaphysical scheme devised by the likes of Plato,
        Aristotle, or any of their philosophical successors. Only through the
        One in Whom the fullness of deity dwells bodily
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Col. 2:9"></logos-bible-citation> can we
        traverse such a chasm. The philosophical enigma that is the problem of
        the one and the many, which our most brilliant minds have chronically
        toiled in vain to overcome for centuries, was answered for us two
        thousand years ago as a sidenote by the God Who is One and Three, the
        indispensable authority and reference point for all human reasoning.
      </logos-words>
      <logos-words title="Theology">
        In Jesus Christ, the God-Man, we find sufficient justification for the
        assumption that the mind’s perception of the rational and the body’s
        experience of the real are equally ultimate and mutually affirming. In
        other words, ideas formulated in the mind can be verified through
        practical experimentation, and observations about reality can be
        comprehended as unified, intelligible concepts. This is the learning
        process. And since only the triune God of the Bible can account for its
        reliability, He is revealed at every point in the process.

        As truth is acquired during the course of a K-12 education, students
        connect the pieces of the puzzle. Like pixels added to a blurry
        photograph, each brings the picture more clearly into focus and further
        verifies the puzzler’s grounding assumptions; the initial, axiomatic
        pixels represented the finished product truly. With academic maturity
        comes ease of idea integration – the incremental ease with which a
        puzzle piece can be incorporated into a puzzle that has long since taken
        shape. Choosing the correct pieces for your puzzle is roughly analogous
        to practicing the art of grammar, as students acquire facts (true puzzle
        pieces) through the learning process. Assembling the puzzle can be
        compared to the sorting, ordering, and refining art of logic through
        which students establish beliefs using formal processes for organizing
        data. An illustration of the art of rhetoric would be to say: “You’ve
        assembled this puzzle for long enough that you know it by heart. Now
        draw it. And with your drawing, convince others that yours is a true
        depiction of the image on the front of the puzzle box.”

        the path to knowledge is traversed by iteratively concluding with

        Very few are able to pinpoint the exact moment of the sunrise – a road

        Spirit’s internal testimony has removed opposition to, and compelled us
        to believe in the self-attesting, freedom-bringing Word of God. Having
        been granted the mind and disposition of Christ at the point of
        regeneration
        <logos-bible-citation cite="1 Cor 2:14-16"></logos-bible-citation>, our
        beliefs become not only true (in that they correspond with the mind of

        to develop and to embrace ever greater depths of divine truth)
        <logos-citation></logos-citation>. Whereas the unbeliever’s every
        thought process begins with the unconscious denial “there is no God”
        <logos-bible-citation cite="Ps 14:1"></logos-bible-citation>, the

        <logos-bible-citation cite="2 Cor 10:5"></logos-bible-citation>, so that
        even our reasoning is directed towards God’s glory. As described by St.
        Augustine, who took Plato’s forms and put them in the mind of God, we
        aspire to “think God’s thoughts after Him” when we pursue knowledge. A
        true belief is formed in faithful submission to the Word of Christ
        because our concepts are but finite reflections of the mind of God. In
        this manner, we have assurance that we can know things truly, though
        analogically and never exhaustively, in proportion to God’s infinite
        comprehension of His Creation.

        a countervailing aversion toward the vanity implied through a story
        written "by me featuring me" as the hero. Various mediums have been
        developed throughout history to mitigate such self-glorification. One
        such medium consists of a historian telling the history of the Empire
        and leaving the last chapter for his own life as its triumphant
        conclusion. There’s even a medieval Chinese autobiographical tradition
        in which authors feigned death as license to produce a self-written
        epitaph. Christianity licenses self-narration of one’s spiritual
        development for the sake of edifying the church and reaching the
        unconvinced. It controls for bias and conceit by posing the Christian as
        sub-author in a larger narrative, and in a supporting role to the true
        hero of the preeminent story – the Lucy to His Aslan. The Christian life
        can thus be put on display as a means of glorifying God and edifying
        future generations. Like the stones of the Jordan
